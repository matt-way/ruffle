		Privacy Policy
	</div>
	<p>
		Effective from July 15, 2015.
	</p>
	<p>Ruffle is a fun way to share photos and pictures with people you know. This privacy policy describes the way that we (Unassigned Pty Ltd) collect, use, share and store your information when you use Ruffle through our mobile apps and website.</p>
	<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time, so please check back regularly.</p>
	<div class="privacy-heading-1">
		Information We Collect
	</div>
	<p>For the app to function, we need to collect, store, and use some information about you.</p>
	<p>When you first use Ruffle we need to collect and verify your phone number. We need to store your phone number so that we can deliver messages that people send to you.</p>
	<p>When you verify your phone number, we use your IP (Internet Protocol) address to determine what country you are in. This means that you probably won't have to select your country from a list (we're trying to save you some time and get you Ruffling faster).</p>
	<p>We also collect and store the operating system of the device that you are using. This allows us to deliver push notifications to you when someone sends you a message.</p>
	<p>When you send a message to someone, the app will access the contacts saved on your device so you can choose who to send the message to. We don't collect or store these anywhere.</p>
	<p>When you use the app to send someone a message, the contact phone number of the message recipient, and the message contents are stored on our servers until they can be delivered to the recipient.</p>
	<p>When we deliver a message to the recipient, only the message contents are delivered. We don't include any other personal information about you.</p>
	<p>When you send someone a message with Ruffle, the contents of that message will likely be delivered to, and stored on the recipient's device. We have no control over what a recipient does with the contents of a message after it has been delivered. For this reason, you probably shouldn't send anything that you don't want saved or shared by someone else.</p>
	<p>When you block a user through the app, we'll do our best to make sure that user can no longer send you messages through Ruffle. However, we can't stop someone from messaging you from another phone number (or through any other medium, like the post, email, or regular SMS, for that matter).</p>
	<p>If you'd like to stop receiving messages from all Ruffle users, we recommend uninstalling the app, and using the 'Block My Number' feature. Verifying your number with 'Block My Number' will stop your phone number from receiving any future messages from Ruffle.</p>

		Information Collected By Third Parties
	</div>
	<p>We provide our advertising partners with some information about the way you use our app so they can advertise products and services that are more likely to be relevant to you.</p>
	<p>Ad networks are companies that manage the advertising process on this and many other apps. For that reason, they may know information about you based on the way you use all the apps where they provide advertising services. They compile this information to paint a picture of which types of adverts you are likely to be interested in.</p>
	<p>You can find out more about how they use your personal information here:</p>

	<p>Ruffle includes measuring tools. We want to learn how you use the app so we can improve it in future updates.</p>
