	<div class="media-heading">Huh, Ruffle?</div>
	<p>Make someone's day. Send fun, anonymous picture messages to anyone with a phone number.</p>
	<p>Ruffle is a fun and free way to share photos and pictures with friends. Take a photo, or select a picture from your galley, and send it to anyone in your contacts. They will have no idea who sent it - unless you send a photo of your face!</p>

	<div class="media-heading">Right, why?</div>
	<p>A 'Ruffle' is the feel you get when something unexpected happens, a blank envelope with a thank you note slid under your door, or the sudden reminder of an inside joke with your BFF, the kind that causes you to laugh out loud on a crowded bus. We want to deliver that feeling, in app form.</p>
